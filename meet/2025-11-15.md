- Exponents
  ```python
  # 2 * 2  is 2 multiplied by 2   (2 x 2)
  # 2 ** 2 is 2 to the power of 2 (2^2)

  # MEMORIZE:
  # - ANY number to the 0 power equals 1

  2    ** 0 == 1
  20   ** 0 == 1
  200  ** 0 == 1
  9999 ** 0 == 1

  # MEMORIZE:
  # - ANY number to the 1 power equals the number

  2    ** 1 == 2
  3    ** 1 == 3
  30   ** 1 == 30
  9999 ** 1 == 9999

  # MEMORIZE:
  # - ANY number to the 2 power or above is the number of times you multiply itself

  2 ** 2   = 2 * 2
  2 ** 3   = 2 * 2 * 2
  2 ** 4   = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
  2 ** 10  = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2

  10 ** 2 = 10 * 10
  10 ** 3 = 10 * 10 * 10

  # Compound Interest
  #
  # You can see how much your money grows with exponents.
  #
  # The formula is money * ((1 + interest_rate) ** years)
  #
  # E.g.
  # - 100 dollars
  # - 8 percent a year interest (0.08)
  # - 9 years

  100 * ((1 + 0.08) ** 9) = ??
